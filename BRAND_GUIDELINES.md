### Typography
We use modern, geometric sans-serif fonts to convey clarity and youthfulness.

*   **Headings:** **Outfit** or **Poppins**
    *   Bold, friendly, and legible. Use for titles and major calls to action.
*   **Body:** **Inter** or **Roboto**
    *   Clean, neutral, and highly readable on screens of all sizes.

## 3. Voice & Tone
*   **Empowering:** We speak *to* young people, not *at* them. Use active, encouraging language.
*   **Inclusive:** Language should be gender-neutral and welcoming to all backgrounds.
*   **Professional yet Accessible:** Avoid bureaucratic jargon. Use clear, simple language that bridges the gap between institutions and youth.
*   **European:** Emphasize connection, mobility, and shared values.

## 4. Logo & Imagery
*   **Logo Usage:** The APG logo should be prominent on the splash screen and header. Ensure high contrast (white logo on orange background, or color logo on white).
*   **Imagery:** Use authentic photos of young people collaborating, workshops, and diverse groups. Avoid stock photos that look too staged.
*   **Iconography:** Use rounded, outline-style icons (e.g., Lucide, Heroicons) that match the friendly typography.

## 5. UI/UX Principles
*   **Mobile-First:** The experience must be flawless on smartphones.
*   **Simplicity:** Minimize clutter. Focus on the core content (events, opportunities, news).
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure high color contrast (WCAG AA standard) and large touch targets.
*   **Dynamic:** Use subtle animations (fades, slides) to make the app feel alive and responsive.
